For this Project, Diana Bergeman, Eric Droegemeier, Triniti Lemmons, Mauricio Sanchez and I analyzed data on the effect of the newly-implemented pitch clock in the MLB on pitchers. We looked for correlations and trends between individual and total pitching statistics from the 2022 and 2023 MLB seasons. We determined that there was minimal to no effect on pitcher performance. We primarily used Python for this project.
