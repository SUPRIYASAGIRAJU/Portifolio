## Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

The objective of this project was to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets related to a specific topic and gain insights
into public opinion and attitudes on social media. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were employed for sentiment analysis. 
Built sentiment classification models
using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The sentiment analysis of Twitter data provided valuable insights into the public sentiment, opinions, and attitudes
regarding the specific topic. These insights could be utilized for brand monitoring, reputation management, customer
feedback analysis, or tracking the impact of events or campaigns on social media.
