## Predictive analysis for Heart Stroke in Patients
This project is aimed to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of heart stroke in patients based on various
health parameters and patient information. The goal was to identify high-risk individuals for early intervention and
preventive measures. 

The trained model was evaluated on the testing set using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the
model's predictive power and determine an appropriate classification threshold.

Based on the model predictions, recommendations could be provided to healthcare professionals for identifying high-risk
patients and implementing preventive strategies, such as lifestyle modifications or targeted medical interventions.
